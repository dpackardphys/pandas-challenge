In this analysis we combined data at the individual student level and overall school level to study student success in the district.
We summarized data for the entire district, and also for each school. We determined the highest and lowest performing school according to overall % of students passing both reading and math. We separated average math and reading scores out by grade for each school. We broke down students scores according to school budget, size, and type (charter or district). A preliminary report is included at the bottom of the notebook.
